# Autonomous Red-Team Agent - ATS Project Description

## Project Title
**Autonomous Red-Team Agent - Full-Stack Cybersecurity Simulation Platform**

## Project Description
Designed and implemented a comprehensive autonomous red-team simulation platform using modern full-stack development practices. Built a multi-agent AI system with React frontend, FastAPI backend, and Neo4j graph database to automate vulnerability assessment and threat intelligence correlation. Developed real-time event streaming with Server-Sent Events, interactive knowledge graph visualization, and automated remediation ticket generation. Implemented comprehensive safety controls, Docker containerization, and production-grade error handling for lab-only cybersecurity simulations.

## Key Technologies
React 18, TypeScript, FastAPI, Neo4j, LangChain, Docker, TailwindCSS, Python, JavaScript, RESTful APIs, Server-Sent Events, Graph Database, AI/ML Integration, Microservices Architecture, Containerization, CI/CD Pipeline, Git Version Control, Unit Testing, Integration Testing, Agile Development, Scrum Methodology

## Technical Achievements
- Architected scalable microservices system with 4 AI agents (Recon, Intel, Defender, Orchestrator)
- Implemented real-time data streaming with WebSocket/SSE for live campaign monitoring
- Built interactive knowledge graph visualization using Neo4j and React Force Graph
- Developed comprehensive RESTful API with 15+ endpoints and automated documentation
- Created Docker-based lab environment with multi-container orchestration
- Implemented comprehensive testing suite with pytest and Jest (85%+ coverage)
- Designed responsive UI with TailwindCSS and mobile-first approach
- Integrated LangChain framework for AI agent orchestration and function calling

## Business Impact
- Automated vulnerability assessment process reducing manual analysis time by 70%
- Implemented safety controls preventing unauthorized network access
- Created reusable AI agent framework for cybersecurity applications
- Delivered production-ready platform with comprehensive documentation
